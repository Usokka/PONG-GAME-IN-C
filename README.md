# PONG-GAME-IN-C
This is the first project i have ever made (in 2023), it is a pong game with a menu, made in C + SDL2 library including SDL ttf

Here are some notices:
1- If you want to edit the code, you must link the SDL2 and SDL2 ttf Libraries.
2- If you want to compile the projet, use this command: gcc main.c game.c racket.c ball.c bot.c button.c menu.c -o bin/'name of the exe file' -I include -L lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
